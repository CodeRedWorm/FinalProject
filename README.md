# FinalProject

# I'm not creative enough to think of something unique and original to do for this project. So with that said I grabbed essentially a random dataset from the vincentarelbundock GitHub. It's the same source for datasets that was used in Module #9.

# The dataset is comprised of 619 students and their individual scores in Math, Science and English (scores are out of 100).

# I wasn't really sure at first what to do with this dataset, but ultimately I decided to do a K-Means clustering analysis that will showcase the student's performance in 2 subjects at the same time.

# K-Means is just going to be abbreviated as km from here on out. In general km clustering allows for a convenient way to designate elements within a data set as belonging to a particular grouping.

# This method of classification can help show structures of the data that otherwise may have gone unnoticed. All this will hopefully make some sense when looking at the charts.
